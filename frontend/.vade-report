# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for the React + Vite application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Added `@vercel/analytics` package to the project using npm
- Package version installed: Latest available version

### 2. Modified Files

**src/App.tsx**
- Added import statement for Analytics component: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react'`
- Added `<Analytics />` component at the end of the JSX return block, right after the `<Toaster />` component
- This ensures analytics tracking is active across all routes in the application

**package.json**
- Added `@vercel/analytics` to the dependencies list

**package-lock.json**
- Updated with the new package and its dependencies

## Implementation Details

Following the official Vercel Web Analytics documentation for React applications, the Analytics component was added to the main App component. This is the recommended approach for Create React App and similar React-based applications built with Vite.

The Analytics component is positioned at the root level to ensure:
- All page views are tracked automatically
- The component initializes once when the app loads
- Works seamlessly with the existing react-router-dom setup

## Testing

- ✅ Build verification completed successfully (`npm run build`)
- ✅ No new linting errors introduced by the changes
- ✅ Analytics component properly imported and rendered

## Next Steps

To enable Web Analytics:
1. Deploy this application to Vercel
2. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard (Project → Analytics tab → Enable)
3. After deployment, verify that `/_vercel/insights/view` requests appear in the browser's Network tab

The implementation is complete and ready for deployment.
